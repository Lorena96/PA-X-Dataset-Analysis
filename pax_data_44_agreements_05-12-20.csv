There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985 Agreement.

The Conference will contribute as appropriate to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party negotiations but will have no power to override the democratic arrangements set up by this Agreement.

The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on 13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.

Page 2, 7. 
In this Framework Document both Governments therefore describe a shared understanding reached between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and direction to the process and to show that a fair and honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the relationships, which would enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or of either community.

Page 2, 9. 
The primary objective of both Governments in their approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support.

Page 2, 9. 
They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement: (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;...

Page 3, 12. 
...They will continue to work towards and encourage the achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ""a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"".

Page 4, Constitutional Issues, 17. 
New arrangements should be in accordance with the commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish. 

Page 5, Constitutional Issues, 20.
...This new approach for Northern Ireland, based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation embodying the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.

Page 11, East-West Structures, 42.
...The Conference will be the principal instrument for an intensification of the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, with particular reference to the principles contained in the Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with the
relations between the two parts of the island of Ireland.

On 9 April, 1995, in the rural “ejido” of San Miguel in Ocosingo Municipality, the federal government and EZLN began a process of dialogue and negotiation based on the desire of the parties to reach a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the conflict which began on 1 January 1994, within the framework of the Law on Dialogue, Accord and dignified Peacemaking in Chiapas, where the National Intermediation Commission (proceeding in a constant active and operational effort of neutralisation) is acting as mediator, and where the Accord and Peacemaking Commission (set up to collaborate, help and participate in the dialogue and negotiation) plays a supporting role.
In accordance with the principles adopted in the San Miguel Declaration, the parties have agreed:
