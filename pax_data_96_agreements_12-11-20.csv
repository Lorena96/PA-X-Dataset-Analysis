...The meeting comes against a backdrop of non-implementation of key provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), more especially the conduct of free and fair general elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan to either confirm unity of Sudan or opt for separation and holding of Abyei referendum on whether Abyei retains its special administrative status in the North or be part of Bahr el Ghazal. The meeting also comes as the simmering crisis in Darfur is intensifying. This underscores the need for extensive dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party with a view to addressing the national crisis Sudan currently faces.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The aim is to ensure full implementation of all peace agreements and all constitutional arrangements prescribed in the Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; including respect for human rights and the rule of law, political empowerment of women, conduct of free and fair elections, holding of referendum for the people of Southern Sudan and popular consultation for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The commitment to resolve the conflict in Darfur is duly emphasized.

...The Leadership Council met on September 26 to adopt the APPC’s agenda and to draw up a set of rules to govern proceedings.

On September 28, the APPC set up 5 working committees to discuss key national issues, namely implementation of all peace agreements, democratic transformation, national reconciliation and healing, economic and social situation in addition to foreign policy.

Page 4, 1. DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL CONSENSUS

3.1.1.2. Enactment of Referendum Bill during the prorogation of the current National Assembly, with simple majority vote (50%+1) being threshold for either confirming unity of Sudan or opting for secession and providing for all Southern Sudanese to take part in this process; and 
3.1.1.3. Demarcation of North-South borders prior to the holding of general elections. 
3.1.2. Emphasizes the importance of bringing all laws in consonance with the INC, 2005 
3.1.5. Adhering to the CPA provisions on making unity attractive, the APPC decides to set up a working group focused on developing political, economic and cultural programs to promote unity during the remainder of the Interim Period while at the same time guaranteeing respect for separation in the event the people of Southern Sudan opt for it.
